## Problem Description
Our data model is for a fictional company called "Terry Teas" the company is a tea shop selling nutrition teas. The database is for the day to day operation of the company. The database includes tables such as Customers, Orders, OrderDetails, LoyaltyPrograms, etc. Our database would help a manager visualise simple things such as listing all customer names, or a more complex query such as total quantity sold for each product. 

## Data Model
<img width="1060" height="413" alt="Screenshot 2026-03-29 at 4 11 20 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47a9a5a7-d151-457f-a64f-f658ee9c2f93" />

Explanation of Data Model:
Our data model represents the structure of a retail and inventory management system that tracks customers, sales, products, suppliers, employees, and store operations.

At the core of the model is the Customers entity, which stores personal information such as name, contact details, and address. Each customer can make multiple purchases, which is why there is a one-to-many relationship between the Customers and Sales entities.

The Sales entity records each transaction, including the sale price, date, and payment method. Because a single sale can involve multiple products, we created an associative entity called Product Line, which connects Sales and Products. This resolves the many-to-many relationship between Sales and Products, allowing each sale to include multiple products and each product to appear in multiple sales.

The Products entity stores details about each item, including product name and type. Products are supplied by vendors, which is represented through the Suppliers entity. Since suppliers can provide multiple products and products can come from multiple suppliers, we use the Supplier Orders associative entity to connect Suppliers and Products. This table also links to Store Location, indicating where products are being delivered.

The Store Location entity represents different store branches, including attributes such as city and state. Supplier Orders are tied to specific locations, establishing a one-to-many relationship between Store Location and Supplier Orders.

Customer purchasing activity is further detailed through the Customer Orders and Customer Order Details entities. Customer Orders represent overall orders placed by customers, while Customer Order Details break down each order into specific products, quantities, shipping dates, and statuses. This creates a structured relationship where:
- One customer can have many orders
- One order can have many order details (products)

To manage promotions, we included a Discount Programs entity. This entity links customers, sales, and specific discount programs, allowing discounts to be applied to particular transactions. This creates relationships between Customers, Sales, and Discount Programs to track promotional usage.

On the organizational side, the Employees entity stores employee information such as name, email, and department. Each employee belongs to a Department, forming a many-to-one relationship (many employees per department). Additionally, the Employees table includes a self-referencing relationship (via PreviousChair), which models succession or reporting structure within the organization.

Finally, the Department entity defines different functional areas within the company, such as sales, management, or operations.

Overall, this data model efficiently captures the relationships between customers, transactions, products, suppliers, and employees, while resolving complex many-to-many relationships through associative entities like Product Line, Supplier Orders, and Customer Order Details.
